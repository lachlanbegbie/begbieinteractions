As a final major design project for my Bachelor of Design (Interaction Design), I chose to create a web-based portfolio for a fictional client, represented by Hugh Begbie.

This project was not restricted in scope or content, so I pursued my interests in web curation and UX design, and applied them to the technical skills I had developed over the three years of my degree.

## Problem

Nearly all FADx promotional materials are redeveloped yearly. The task presented was to design a website which matched the newly developed visual style, and provided a contribution which was differentiated from other promotional mediums.

A FADx website had previously been developed, but was an example of a disproportional scope. Built during COVID, when an in-person event could not be run, the site sought to display information on every graduating student, which massively increased the scope and cost of the project. The solution we developed would seek to prevent this issue by limiting its scope.

## Product

A test deployment of the site is available at <a href="https://lachlanbegbie.github.io/photography_portfolio/" target="_blank">lachlanbegbie.github.io/photography_portfolio/</a>.

<!-- ## Solution

### Ideation

#### Feature List

With freedom to include the features we deemed beneficial, we settled on the most effective content - event information, limited student spotlights and sponsor highlights.

#### Low and High Fidelity Prototypes

In communication with other FADx development teams, we developed prototypes using Figma, to outline a visual style and layout for the site.

I programmed the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The relevant data was stored in a JSON file and insterted into the site through JavaScript API techniques. The style of the site evolved through communication with the client, and much applicable feedback was provided.

## Conclusion

This project served as intended, to consolidate the knowledge I have learned over the course of my degree. I have a general idea now of what I can do, and am more aware of my limitations.

Even over the last 6 months I have learned new techniques which would have benefited this project -->
