As a final major design project for my Bachelor of Design (Interaction Design), I chose to create a web-based portfolio for a fictional client, represented by Hugh Begbie.

This project was not restricted in scope or content, so I pursued my interests in web curation and UX design, and applied them to the technical skills I had developed over the three years of my degree.

## Problem

The main problems which I aimed to challenge in this project were the consideration of a client's needs, visually and functionally, and the manageable display of collection items.

I focused on two areas to manage this project - the first was how the site may be used. I needed it to be an image gallery, but it should also act as a promotional material for the client, and so should include a personal bio, services available, and contact information as well. The second area to focus on was the back-end usability. It should dynamically respond to the data it is given, so that any new image or collection could be added without rewriting any code.

## Product

A test deployment of the site is available at <a href="https://lachlanbegbie.github.io/photography_portfolio/" target="_blank">lachlanbegbie.github.io/photography_portfolio/</a>.

<!-- ## Solution

### Ideation

#### Feature List

With freedom to include the features we deemed beneficial, we settled on the most effective content - event information, limited student spotlights and sponsor highlights.

#### Low and High Fidelity Prototypes

In communication with other FADx development teams, we developed prototypes using Figma, to outline a visual style and layout for the site.

I programmed the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The relevant data was stored in a JSON file and insterted into the site through JavaScript API techniques. The style of the site evolved through communication with the client, and much applicable feedback was provided.

## Conclusion

This project served as intended, to consolidate the knowledge I have learned over the course of my degree. I have a general idea now of what I can do, and am more aware of my limitations.

Even over the last 6 months I have learned new techniques which would have benefited this project -->
