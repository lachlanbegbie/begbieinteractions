As a UX technical exercise, I considered how gamification (the process of bringing game design elements into non-game scenarios) can be used to enhance user experience. I developed a prototype app interface which utilises gamification techniques to encourage engagement with the NSW tourism industry.

## Problem

Much of the research into gamification stresses the importance of balance in optimising the effectiveness of the techniques. Overloading the user with moving parts and engaging features can distract from the intended purpose of the app, and harm the user experience. This was a balance I aimed to maintain in my design.

<!-- ## Solution

### Ideation

#### Feature List

With freedom to include the features we deemed beneficial, we settled on the most effective content - event information, limited student spotlights and sponsor highlights.

#### Low and High Fidelity Prototypes

![alt text](address.ext "Title")

In communication with other FADx development teams, we developed prototypes using Figma, to outline a visual style and layout for the site.

### Product

![alt text](address.ext "Title")

Based on the high fidelity prototype, we programmed the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The relevant data was stored in a JSON file and insterted into the site through JavaScript functions.

The site went live to [uxfadx2025.com.au](https://uxfadx2025.com.au) on 13th October 2024, and was updated through to the in-person event on 13th-15th November 2024.

## Conclusion

On reflection, the final product produced worked successfully to the intended extent.

There were more suitable ways to store and display the data, which would have helped make the site maintainable if needed again in future years. These methods were out of our reach in the time frame for development, but could be considered in future iterations of the product. -->
