The University of Canberra's Faculty of Arts and Design runs an annual exhibition of graduating students' work. As a 2024 graduate, I was involved in the setup for the event, with a role designing the website alongside fellow Interaction Design graduates Ezra Readhead and Navya Vinod Moorthy.

## Problem

Nearly all FADx promotional materials are redeveloped yearly. the task presented was to design a website which matched the newly developed visual style, and provided a contribution which was differentiated from other promotional mediums.

A FADx website had previously been developed, but was an example of a disproportional scope. Built during COVID, when an in-person event could not be run, the site sought to display information on every graduating student, which massively increased the scope and cost of the project. The solution we developed would seek to prevent his issue by limiting its scope.

<!-- ## Solution

### Ideation

#### Feature List

With freedom to include the features we deemed beneficial, we settled on the most effective content - event information, limited student spotlights and sponsor highlights.

#### Low and High Fidelity Prototypes

![alt text](address.ext "Title")

In communication with other FADx development teams, we developed prototypes using Figma, to outline a visual style and layout for the site.

### Product

![alt text](address.ext "Title")

Based on the high fidelity prototype, we programmed the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The relevant data was stored in a JSON file and insterted into the site through JavaScript functions.

The site went live to [uxfadx2025.com.au](https://uxfadx2025.com.au) on 13th October 2024, and was updated through to the in-person event on 13th-15th November 2024.

## Conclusion

On reflection, the final product produced worked successfully to the intended extent.

There were more suitable ways to store and display the data, which would have helped make the site maintainable if needed again in future years. These methods were out of our reach in the time frame for development, but could be considered in future iterations of the product. -->
